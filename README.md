# Snowsql Formatter

Get https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowsql-formatter running in Docker.

## Try output

* Does this even format the SQL well?
* Would tweaking the settings help?
* What specific Snowflake-specific things does it format well?

## TODO

* The Snowflake fork is really far behind [the original](https://github.com/sql-formatter-org/sql-formatter)
  * Can the Snowflake-specific changes be ported?
* Is there a SQL formatter that works well-enough with Snowflake?
